# ðŸ¥‹ Airflow basics
The material in this section (kata) is intended to provide a basic understanding of Apache Airflow. The exercises are designed to be completed in order, as they build on each other.

You should set aside 1-3 hours to complete the exercises and get familiar with the documentation, tooling and concepts.

## Pre-requisites
- text editor
- Docker (and optionally docker compose)
- web browser 

## ðŸ§  Exercises
*There are relatively few hints next to the exercises. Use any resource you want to find a solution, there are many different ways to solve the exercises below.*

1. Run Airflow in a Docker container and log-in
1. Enable the example DAGs and run one
1. Create a new DAG that prints "Hello, World!" to the logs
1. Create a new dynamic DAG. The dag should create all permutations of `[a, b, c]` tasks.
1. Modify the previously created DAG to always skip the task `c` if it comes after taks `a`.
1. Create a new DAG that queries data from a server

      <li>Set up docker compose to also run a database alongside Airflow (recommended to use docker compose and to extend the compose file)</li>
      <li>Create the connection in the Airflow UI</li>
      <li>Create a new DAG that queries data from the database</li>
      </ul>

## ðŸ’¡ Hints
### Docker
Get familiar with the Dockerfile and build the image.
```bash
docker build -t airflow-ds:latest .
```

Run the image and mount your dags folder, so you will have a quick feedback loop while working on the exercises.
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 airflow-ds:latest --volume ./dags:/opt/airflow/dags
```
*with compose:*
```bash
docker compose up -d
```


### Airflow
#### with a pre-configure user
log in: `airflow`
password: `airflow`
#### without configuring a new user
log in: admin
password: `cat standalone_admin_password.txt`
